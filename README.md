# INotify PDF Tools Docker Container

The container is intended to monitor the `input` folder. As soon as a new file is created there, the `$CMD` envirenment variable is executed.

---

Usecase

I use the container to split PDF files from my printer into separate PDF documents to process them separately afterwards.
